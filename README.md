# 2D-GAME
# OVER VIEW
We have designed a 2D game using the concept of object oriented language (OOP) and also by using SFML which is an external language of C++.
We have designed an adventure game where the hero kills the enemy and reach to different levels and gain points.
We have created the characters by using Photoshop (pixel version) and have done the animation. 
# PURPOSE
The purpose of designing this game was to clear our concept about OOP.
To know more about C++ and as this idea was a different one we decided to work on it. 
Getting to know about Photoshop more and other external Languages like SFML and C++. 
This was an interesting topic for those who had an interest in game development.  
# LANGUAGE USED
The concept of object oriented programming was used and the languages we used were the SFML external language of C++ and other language was C++
# LEARNING OUTCOME
o	We successfully designed a 2 D game with the help SFML and the core concepts of Object-oriented programming. 
Our project consists of different libraries of SFML that help us to successfully create our game.
